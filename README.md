DeTerminus Font
===============

Slightly modified Terminus font. Based on Terminus 20 and 22.

I'm focusing on the 20 version now.

Changed glyphs:

__20__

* a
* pqgy
* {}|\(\)\\[] slightly larger
* R

__22__

* {} to distinguish from ()
* | slightly longer

__both__

* _ slightly longer, moved up a pixel
